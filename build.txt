IMPORTANT:
currently truss is known to work with bgfx commit
3813b28e9bdbad309e3f77dafb78b10a5818888e

Windows (vs2013):
	Dependencies: bgfx, bx, terra, sdl
		Get and build bgfx + bx (bx is header only and needed by bgfx):
			git clone git://github.com/bkaradzic/bx.git
			git clone git://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx.git
			cd bgfx
			..\bx\tools\bin\windows\genie --with-shared-lib --with-tools vs2013
			(might also want --with-ovr)
			(note: what does --with-sdl do? It doesn't seem to be needed...)
			start .build\projects\vs2013\bgfx.sln
			make sure to build in x64!

Linux:
	Dependencies: bgfx, bx, terra, sdl
		Get and build bgfx + bx (bx is header only and needed by bgfx):
			git clone git://github.com/bkaradzic/bx.git
			git clone git://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx.git
			[needed?] sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev
			cd bgfx
			make linux-release64

			Note: if you want bgfx to use opengl > 2.1, then you need to compile it with
			e.g. #define BGFX_CONFIG_RENDERER_OPENGL 31
			either by manually setting this define (ex: in bgfx/src/config.h) or through
			the build process somehow

		Get terra (linux binaries available):
			https://github.com/zdevito/terra/releases

		Get SDL:
			sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev

		Edit CMakeLists.txt to reflect where you put bgfx, bx, and terra:
			cd truss
			gedit CMakeLists.txt

		Make:
			mkdir build
			cd build
			cmake ..
			make
		
		Copy the binary into the root truss dir:
			cd ..
			cp build/truss .

		Now you can hopefully run:
			./truss examples/dart_gui_test.t
