# Truss Documentation

This directory contains documentation for truss built with [Jekyll](), the
default static-site generator used by GitHub Pages. The contents of this
directory in the `master` branch are automatically built and deployed to
https://truss.github.io/ on every commit.

To develop locally, install [Docker]() and use the included `Makefile`. The
default `make` command starts a local development server that will incrementally
update as changes are made to this site. The locally hosted docs can be viewed
at http://localhost:4000.

**TL;DR:**

```
# Step 0: Install `docker` and `make`
# Step 1:
$ make
```
