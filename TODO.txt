Lua:
	Gui
		-- Console
		-- Mouse camera control

	Scenegraph
		-- Basic transform math
		-- Actual scenegraph
		-- How to handle materials etc.? (just have nodes implement 'draw' however they want, let actual scenegraph just deal with keeping transformations consistent)

	Simplify mesh loading
		-- Wrappers for static buffer construction

	Materials / Lighting
		--??


C++:
	Key value database of some kind?
	-- Store trss_messages indexed by string keys
	-- Save / load entire database to file
	-- Thread safe

	PhysFS?
	-- Extra dependency but might be nice
	-- Maybe compile time flag to enable

	Better logging
	-- Save to file
	-- Streams for C++ side
