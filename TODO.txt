Buffers:
	- wrap buffers into a Geometry class

Rendering:
	- Renderer ==> RenderPass
	- Views/iterators of SceneGraphs / collections

Organization:
	- Move everything into bgfx/ directory?
	-  or maybe graphics/?

Examples:
	- 00 - minimal (just starts up and immediately exits)
	- 01 - clear color (just clears the screen to a garish color)
	- 02 - cube (it's a cube)
